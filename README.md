# Console-Finances

## Description
As requested in week 4 challange, I was required to create a command line application that allows the user to add, edit, and remove expenses. This application will be used to keep track of expenses. 
<br>
You cac see that I made two attempts to make this project. My first attempt did work but gave the wrong financial outcome.
<br>
In the secaond attempt, I fixed the code, and made it more accurate. The new term, *change*, was introduced to represent the difference in profits or losses between one month and the next. This helped in understanding how the finances fluctuate. Next, the conditions that check for the highest increase and decrease were updated. Instead of directly looking at the profit or loss values, the code now considers the *change* variable. This adjustment ensured I manged to give a more accurate identification of the months with the biggest positive and negative changes. Finally, when displaying the results, the code had updated to show which months had the highest increase and decrease using the variables "maxIncreaseMonth" and "maxDecreaseMonth." These changes make the financial analysis more reliable.
<br>
This is a screenshot of the successful application.
